  <p style="margin-top:30px;"> <img src="IMG_6705.jpg" width="50%"><br><br>To meet japanese people there are many ways, if you go to the bars or restaurants in Nagoya, many of the japanese servers are college students and some have good english skills, and if you engage them in a casual conversation, they will be happy to talk with you. Of course speaking japanese helps but in any way you communicate with them,its good.
  Go to the Izakayas-drinking bars-In those places, just about everyone there is in a social and friendly mood. Nagoya, is a crowded place so there should be many opportunities to meet people.</p></h4>
